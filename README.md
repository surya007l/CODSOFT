# CODSOFT


Welcome to my **CodSoft AI Internship** repository!  
As part of my internship, I built five AI/ML projects that demonstrate practical applications of artificial intelligence, ranging from conversational agents to computer vision systems. Each project is designed with clarity, functionality, and performance in mind.

## üìÅ Projects Overview

### 1. ü§ñ Chatbot with Rule-Based Responses
A basic chatbot that responds using pre-defined rule sets.  
- Implemented simple NLP logic using keyword matching and decision trees.  
- Designed to simulate intelligent responses for common queries.  
- Lightweight, efficient, and ideal for beginners exploring conversational AI.

### 2. ‚ùå‚≠ï Tic-Tac-Toe with AI
A command-line game of Tic-Tac-Toe featuring an AI opponent.  
- Utilized the **Minimax algorithm** to implement an unbeatable AI.  
- Developed using Python and NumPy for efficient board handling.  
- Great practice for understanding game theory and recursion in AI.

### 3. üñºÔ∏è Image Captioning
An end-to-end deep learning project that generates captions for images.  
- Combined **CNNs** (for feature extraction using models like VGG16/Inception) with **LSTM** (for sequence generation).  
- Used pretrained image embeddings and trained on datasets like Flickr8k.  
- Demonstrates vision-language integration in AI applications.

### 4. üéØ Recommendation System
A content-based and collaborative filtering recommender.  
- Built using **Pandas**, **Scikit-Learn**, and **Cosine Similarity**.  
- Applied to datasets like movie preferences to suggest relevant items.  
- Ideal for e-commerce, entertainment, or any personalization-driven platform.

### 5. üß† Face Detection and Recognition
A robust system to detect and recognize human faces in real-time.  
- Employed **OpenCV** with **Haar Cascades** and **LBPH/FaceNet** models.  
- Achieves accurate identification and live detection via webcam.  
- Can be extended into security, attendance systems, or smart home devices.
